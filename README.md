This is a continuation of the excellent [cerebroApp](https://github.com/romanhaa/cerebroApp) R package from [Roman Hillje](https://github.com/romanhaa), which was sadly discontinued.
This is supposed to be a lightweight version that only keeps the key functions and focuses on speed.

The package can be installed with

```r
remotes::install_github('mihem/cerebroApp-lite')
```

# cerebroApp

R package that provides an interactive visualization of single cell RNA-seq data.
[Seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) v3, v4 and v5 are supported.
To increase speed use [h5](https://github.com/Bioconductor/HDF5Array) or [BPCells](https://github.com/bnprks/BPCells) matrix.
